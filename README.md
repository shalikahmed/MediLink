# summary of the Medilink

MEDILINK is a comprehensive and innovative web application designed to connect doctors and patients, particularly high-risk patients, for prompt attention and care. It features end-to-end encrypted chat, EHR accessibility, video conferencing, voice-based AI for in-platform navigation, chat-bot for finding relevant doctors, SOS emergency call, and real-time notifications. The platform's emphasis on privacy and security through its encrypted chat and EHR accessibility is noteworthy, as is its video conferencing feature for remote consultations. MEDILINK's voice-based AI and chat-bot features are designed to make the platform more accessible to patients who may have difficulty navigating traditional interfaces or finding the right specialist. The reminder system and real-time notifications could improve patient adherence to medication schedules and appointments, while the SOS emergency call feature could potentially save lives. Overall, MEDILINK has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling doctors to provide better care to their patients and patients to manage their health more effectively.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
